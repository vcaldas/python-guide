msgid ""
"For the most part, Python aims to be a clean and consistent language that "
"avoids surprises. However, there are a few cases that can be confusing to "
"newcomers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:13
msgid ""
"Some of these cases are intentional but can be potentially surprising. Some "
"could arguably be considered language warts. In general, what follows is a "
"collection of potentially tricky behavior that might seem strange at first "
"glance, but is generally sensible once you're aware of the underlying cause "
"for the surprise."

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:27
msgid ""
"Seemingly the *most* common surprise new Python programmers encounter is "
"Python's treatment of mutable default arguments in function definitions."

msgid "What Does Happen"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:64
msgid ""
"A new list is created *once* when the function is defined, and the same list"
" is used in each successive call."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:67
msgid ""
"Python's default arguments are evaluated *once* when the function is "
"defined, not each time the function is called (like it is in say, Ruby). "
"This means that if you use a mutable default argument and mutate it, you "
"*will* and have mutated that object for all future calls to the function as "
"well."
msgstr ""

msgid "What You Should Do Instead"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:75
msgid ""
"Create a new object each time the function is called, by using a default arg"
" to signal that no argument was provided (:py:data:`None` is often a good "
"choice)."

msgid "When the Gotcha Isn't a Gotcha"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:91
msgid ""
"Sometimes you can specifically \"exploit\" (read: use as intended) this "
"behavior to maintain state between calls of a function. This is often done "
"when writing a caching function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Late Binding Closures"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:100
msgid ""
"Another common source of confusion is the way Python binds its variables in "
"closures (or in the surrounding global scope)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:119
msgid ""
"A list containing five functions that each have their own closed-over ``i`` "
"variable that multiplies their argument, producing::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:139
msgid ""
"Five functions are created; instead all of them just multiply ``x`` by 4."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:141
msgid ""
"Python's closures are *late binding*. This means that the values of "
"variables used in closures are looked up at the time the inner function is "
"called."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:145
msgid ""
"Here, whenever *any* of the returned functions are called, the value of "
"``i`` is looked up in the surrounding scope at call time. By then, the loop "
"has completed and ``i`` is left with its final value of 4."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:149
msgid ""
"What's particularly nasty about this gotcha is the seemingly prevalent "
"misinformation that this has something to do with :ref:`lambdas "
"<python:lambda>` in Python. Functions created with a ``lambda`` expression "
"are in no way special, and in fact the same exact behavior is exhibited by "
"just using an ordinary ``def``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:170
msgid ""
"The most general solution is arguably a bit of a hack. Due to Python's "
"aforementioned behavior concerning evaluating default arguments to functions"
" (see :ref:`default_args`), you can create a closure that binds immediately "
"to its arguments by using a default arg like so:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:180
msgid "Alternatively, you can use the functools.partial function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:193
msgid ""
"Sometimes you want your closures to behave this way. Late binding is good in"
" lots of situations. Looping to create unique functions is unfortunately a "
"case where they can cause hiccups."

msgid "Bytecode (.pyc) Files Everywhere!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:202
msgid ""
"By default, when executing Python code from files, the Python interpreter "
"will automatically write a bytecode version of that file to disk, e.g. "
"``module.pyc``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:206
msgid ""
"These ``.pyc`` files should not be checked into your source code "
"repositories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:208
msgid ""
"Theoretically, this behavior is on by default for performance reasons. "
"Without these bytecode files present, Python would re-generate the bytecode "
"every time the file is loaded."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling Bytecode (.pyc) Files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:216
msgid ""
"Luckily, the process of generating the bytecode is extremely fast, and isn't"
" something you need to worry about while developing your code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:219
msgid "Those files are annoying, so let's get rid of them!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:225
msgid ""
"With the ``$PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`` environment variable set, Python will "
"no longer write these files to disk, and your development environment will "
"remain nice and clean."

"Run that from the root directory of your project, and all ``.pyc`` files "

msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:246
msgid ""
"If you still need the ``.pyc`` files for performance reasons, you can always"
" add them to the ignore files of your version control repositories. Popular "
"version control systems have the ability to use wildcards defined in a file "
"to apply special rules."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/gotchas.rst:251
msgid ""
"An ignore file will make sure the matching files don't get checked into the "
"repository. Git_ uses ``.gitignore`` while Mercurial_ uses ``.hgignore``."
