"Most image processing and manipulation techniques can be carried out "
"effectively using two libraries: Python Imaging Library (PIL) and Open "
"Source Computer Vision (OpenCV)."

"The `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, or "
"PIL for short, is one of the core libraries for image manipulation in "
"Python. Unfortunately, its development has stagnated, with its last release "
"in 2009."

"Luckily for you, there's an actively-developed fork of PIL called `Pillow "
"<http://python-pillow.github.io/>`_ -- it's easier to install, runs on all "
"major operating systems, and supports Python 3."

"In Python, image processing using OpenCV is implemented using the ``cv2`` "
