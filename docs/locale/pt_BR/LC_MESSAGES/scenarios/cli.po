"Command-line applications, also referred to as `Console Applications "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application>`_, are computer programs "
"designed to be used from a text interface, such as a `shell "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)>`_. Command-line "
"applications usually accept various inputs as arguments, often referred to "
"as parameters or sub-commands, as well as options, often referred to as "
"flags or switches."

"`Plac <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plac>`_ is a simple wrapper over the "
"Python standard library `argparse "
"<http://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html>`_, which hides most of its "
"complexity by using a declarative interface: the argument parser is inferred"
" rather than written down by imperatively. This module targets especially "
"unsophisticated users, programmers, sysadmins, scientists, and in general "
"people writing throw-away scripts for themselves, who choose to create a "
"command-line interface because it is quick and simple."

" to be used to create multi-level commands such as ``svn`` and ``git``, "
"where the main program handles some basic argument parsing and then invokes "
"a sub-command to do the work."
