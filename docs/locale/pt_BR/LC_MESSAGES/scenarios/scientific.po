"Python is frequently used for high-performance scientific applications. It "
"is widely used in academia and scientific projects because it is easy to "

"Due to its high performance nature, scientific computing in Python often "
"utilizes external libraries, typically written in faster languages (like C, "
"or Fortran for matrix operations). The main libraries used are `NumPy`_, "
"`SciPy`_ and `Matplotlib`_. Going into detail about these libraries is "
"beyond the scope of the Python guide. However, a comprehensive introduction "
"to the scientific Python ecosystem can be found in the `Python Scientific "
"Lecture Notes <http://scipy-lectures.github.com/>`_."

"`IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ is an enhanced version of Python "
"interpreter, which provides features of great interest to scientists. The "
"`inline mode` allows graphics and plots to be displayed in the terminal (Qt "
"based version). Moreover, the `notebook` mode supports literate programming "
"and reproducible science generating a web-based Python notebook. This "
"notebook allows you to store chunks of Python code alongside the results and"
" additional comments (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown). The notebook can then be "
"shared and exported in various file formats."

msgid ""
"`NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ is a low level library written in C (and "
"Fortran) for high level mathematical functions. NumPy cleverly overcomes the"
" problem of running slower algorithms on Python by using multidimensional "
"arrays and functions that operate on arrays. Any algorithm can then be "
"expressed as a function on arrays, allowing the algorithms to be run "
"quickly."
